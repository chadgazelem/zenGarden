Relaxed jungle theme. Cool colors and muted tones. Lots of smooth edges, 
simple and clean text. Largely san-serif for a clean simple look. 
The goal is smooth and flowing.

We are going to take the “Select a Design”, “Archives”, and “Resources” 
and give them one set theme, grouping them together as links.

The other sections will be grouped together in the main body

The grouping will be similar to http://csszengarden.com/209/page1/ but 
the appearance will be much less pointy and sharp.

The color scheme is going to be cool and somewhat reminiscent of a 
cool misty jungle
